Designed for low complexity circuits requiring large DFT calculations, sacrificing speed. This specific implementation offers 4-point, 8-point, and 16-point versions of the Fourier Transform, while having the precision set to 4 bits.For the first part, it integrates reverse bit ordering placing data to their corresponding memory address as they are being input from the user. Afterwards, data, along with the weights, are fed through a single butterfly module (2-point DFT), responsible for all the calculations, controlled by the control unit which delegates the data reading/writing throughout each clock cycle. Once finished, the data output process begins. The FFT is calculated using fixed-point arithmetic.# How to operate Connect the proper I/O for inserting data/controlling the circuit, and displaying/reading output. Follow the steps as shown below:- **Step 1**: Reset the IC by momentarily enabling the rst signal.     - **Step 2**: Cycle through the 3 modes (0: 4-point, 1: 8-point, 2: 16-point FFT) shown on the 7-segment display using the mode_change pin, and select the mode you wish to use by using the enter pin.- **Step 3**: Insert data in the specified format (Q1.3 real and Q1.3 imaginary), and use enter pin to input each point. After inserting all data, the FFT computation will begin.- **Step 4**: Use the enter pin again to read the data from the output pins. - **Step 5**: Once all data points are read, the display will show an F, indicating that the data reading is finished. - **Step 6**: Use enter pin to repeat process form **Step 2**.
